this layout is my successor to ["Oats"](https://github.com/rowie324/Oats) 
edit: oats has since been updated and is now my preferred layout.
  
Oats, while statistically looking better, had a few rather significant issues that i failed to notice until attempting to daily drive it.  
Most notably, the placement of "Y" above the pinky; the letter is just too common to be an upwards stretch on one of the weakest fingers. Secondarily, Having "," and "." on the pinky fingers was sub optimal at best.

this new layout, attempts to address these issues while also:  
- maintaining high homerow usage
- and keeping uncommon letters out the way
- - at least according to english corpora

I hope my findings are also interesting to those that stumble upon this c:
